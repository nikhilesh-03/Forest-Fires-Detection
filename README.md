🔥 Forest Fires Detection
This project is designed to predict and detect forest fires using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It consists of two core functionalities:

1. 🔍 Fire Occurrence Prediction
Using the forestfires.csv dataset, which includes various geographical and meteorological features (like temperature, humidity, wind, and FFMC), the model predicts the likelihood of a forest fire occurring in a specific location. This is done using traditional ML models such as MLP Classifier, helping in early risk assessment and prevention.

2. 🖼️ Image-Based Fire Detection
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to classify images as "fire" or "no fire". This helps in real-time image-based monitoring, enabling emergency services to respond faster and more accurately when visual data is available (e.g., from surveillance drones or forest cams).
