# 🔥 Forest Fires Detection

This project is designed to **predict and detect forest fires** using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It consists of two core functionalities:

## 1. 🔍 Fire Occurrence Prediction
Using the `forestfires.csv` dataset, which includes various **geographical and meteorological features** (like temperature, humidity, wind, and FFMC), the model predicts the **likelihood of a forest fire occurring in a specific location**. This is done using traditional ML models such as **MLP Classifier**, helping in **early risk assessment and prevention**.

## 2. 🖼️ Image-Based Fire Detection
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model is trained to classify images as **"fire" or "no fire"**. This helps in **real-time image-based monitoring**, enabling emergency services to respond **faster and more accurately** when visual data is available (e.g., from surveillance drones or forest cams).

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python, Flask** – Web interface and server
- **scikit-learn** – ML model for tabular data
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – CNN for image classification
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Frontend for the web app

---

## 🌍 Impact
This dual-approach system provides both **predictive analytics** and **real-time fire detection**, supporting **quick decision-making and resource allocation** in forest management and disaster response.
